/*
    This script is designed to help control in-box bloat. 

    If you are the sort of person who uses their in-box as long-term storage, don't use this script.

    The text of this script needs to be saved in google drive as a Google Apps Script. If you don't see that option in the New dropdown menu, then select +Connect More Apps.
    This script will start at a specified point down in your message threads, then delete up to the max number of messages specified. It can be set to delete only unread messages (I figure that if I haven't read it and another 1000 messages or more have come in on top if it, I'm never going to read it), or all messages.
    To set it to run automatically (every day, every hour, whatever you want), then set a trigger. Click the clock icon in the left-most panel of the app script editor window. Choose the deleteMessages function to run. Choose the Head deployment. Select the Time-driven option. I like the Day timer so mine runs once in the middle of the night. I've set the failure notification to notify me immediately.
